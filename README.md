# FlagAI

FlagAI is a web app that is meant for whistleblowers to be able to report incidents of degenerative AI. These reports are sent to government agencies who can take action towards the malicious AI program. Please note that this system is a class project originally created by a group of five students, the system is not monitored, and no real information should be submitted.

My Contributions: 

As the Requirements Elicitation Manager for our project, I played a crucial role in shaping the direction and functionality of our application by ensuring it met the needs of its intended users. My primary responsibilities involved interacting with potential and qualified users to gather valuable insights and feedback. This process included conducting interviews and surveys to understand user expectations, pain points, and desired features. After collecting the data, I meticulously compiled and analyzed the responses to ensure that the information was both readable and understandable for our development team.

I communicated these insights to my group members, ensuring everyone was aligned with our users' expectations. To facilitate efficient project management, I created detailed issues in GitHub, which served as a roadmap for our sprints in our agile development process. These issues were prioritized and organized to enable our team to tackle tasks systematically, ensuring we delivered incremental improvements aligned with user requirements.

In addition to my role as Requirements Elicitation Manager, I made significant contributions to our project by focusing on the development of UI/UX, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. I played a key role in setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), streamlining our development workflow.

Furthermore, I assisted in backend development, contributing to the design and implementation of our application's core functionalities such as the set up and maintainance of our persistent PostgreSQL database, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval. These combined efforts helped create a robust, user-friendly, and efficiently deployed application.
